I grew up tinkering with computers, breaking stuff here and there, gaining experience throughout the journey until 2018 when I first heard about the GPT 1 model that might change the world one day...
I was fascinated by the fact that we can somehow imitate the human brain in certain tasks so I decided to enroll in the Faculty of Computers & Artificial Intelligence to someday make my dreams of making a virtual scientist true!
I'm currently a computer Power-User and a Data science student who's interested in various topics of Computer science.
